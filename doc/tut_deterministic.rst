=====================================
Step 1: Define the deterministic case
=====================================

The first step is to create a deterministic case, that is a description of the
calculation to be done. As our example uses the GENERICSOLVER module, first
you must activate this module:

.. image:: /_static/activate_gensolver.png
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <br/>

.. image:: /_static/new_gensolver.png
   :align: center

Then create a calculation case:

.. image:: /_static/new_detcase.png
   :align: center

You can modify the values of the different variables if you want, but note
that the values of the variables that you will define as parametric will be
overrided.

.. image:: /_static/setvalue_detcase.png
   :align: center

You can also run a deterministic calculation of the deviation of the beam with
the values set for the variables:

.. image:: /_static/runsolver_detcase.png
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <br/>

.. image:: /_static/result_detcase.png
   :align: center

Now we have defined the target of our parametric study. It's time to describe
what this study will look like.
