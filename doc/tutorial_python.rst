Tutorial: Parametric study using a Python script as the solver code
###################################################################

This tutorial explains how to create and run a parametric study using a Python
script as the solver code. We will use an example script that implements a
classical example: the computation of the deviation of a cantilever beam.

This computation is done with the simple formula
*dev = (F * L * L * L) / (3. * E * I)*, where *dev* is the deviation, *F* is
the vertical force applied to the end of the beam, *L* is the length of the
beam, *E* is the Young's modulus and *I* is the section modulus.
