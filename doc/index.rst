Parametric module documentation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This documentation covers the usage of PARAMETRIC module in Salome. This module
aims at creating and running parametric studies in Salome. Here, the term
"parametric study" means a simulation where one or several numerical parameters
can vary in a given range. This module provides a way to run the simulation for
different values of those parameters, and to distribute the computations across
several machines.

The documentation of this module is divided in three parts. The two tutorials
give a quick insight in the usage and goals of this module. The reference guide
details the main features of the module.
