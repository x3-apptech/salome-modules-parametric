Parametric module documentation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This module is still experimental in Salome 6.6 and is not documented yet.
Documentation and full support will be available in Salome 7.

In particular, please note that the persistence format is not final yet. This
means that you will not be able to reuse the Parametric Studies created with
Salome 6.6 in future versions. Be sure to export your results in CSV files
before migrating to Salome 7.
