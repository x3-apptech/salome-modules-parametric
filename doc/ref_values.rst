====================================
Definition of the experimental plane
====================================

The PARAMETRIC module offers three methods to define the experimental plane
(i.e. the set of values that the parametric variables can take).

Complete sampling of a given domain
===================================

The user must define ranges for each parametric variable. A range is described
by:

* The minimum value (that will be included in the generated sample)
* The maximum value (that will **not** be included in the generated sample)
* The step between two consecutive values

The domain that is defined by those ranges is then sampled completely and
regularly to build the experimental plane.

Generation by a Python script
=============================

A Python script written by the user creates the whole sample. The script must
create a Numpy array that contains all the points of the experimental plane.
The dimension of this array must thus be (n, d) where n is the number of
points in the sample and d is the number of parametric variables. This Numpy
array must be stored in a variable named "sample".

Example of a script that specifies the whole sample::

   import numpy as np
   sample = np.array(((900.0,  0.5),
                      (800.0,  0.6),
                      (850.0,  0.2),
                      (1032.0, 0.8),
                      (1420.2, 0.5)))

Example of a script building the sample as the cartesian product of two lists::

   import numpy as np
   import itertools

   F_values = (900.0, 800.0, 850.0, 1032.0, 1420.2)
   L_values = (0.5, 0.6, 0.2, 0.8, 1.0)

   it = itertools.product(F_values, L_values)
   sample = np.array(list(it))


Importation of a sample defined in a CSV file
=============================================

The sample is imported from a CSV file defined by the user. This file must
meet some requirements:

* The separator character must be "," (comma). Thus the decimal separator for
  numerical values must be "." (dot).
* The first line of the file must contain the name of the parametric variables
  separated by commas in order to identify the columns of the file.
* Each other line must contain a number of values equal to the number of
  parametric variables, separated by commas. Each line corresponds to a point
  in the sample.

Example of a CSV file containing variables *F* and *L*::

   F,L
   900,0.5
   800,0.6
   850,0.2
   1032,0.8
   1420.2,0.5
