=====================================================================
Step 2: Define the parametric variables and the variables of interest
=====================================================================

In this step we will define the variables that will be exchanged between
the PARAMETRIC module and the calculation code (DEVIATION in our example). The
parametric variables are the input variables of the calculation code that will
vary in a given range. Let's say that in our example, *F* and *L* are the two
parametric variables and *E* and *I* are fixed variables.

The variables of interest are the output variables of the calculation code
that we want to study. In our example, there is only one output variable and
thus only one variable of interest: the deviation *dev*. 

To define those variables, you first have to activate the PARAMETRIC module.

Then click on the button |button_new_study| to create a new parametric study
and to open the variables definition window.

Now select the item "Variables" in the object browser under the deterministic
case and click button "Select". The left side of the window will be filled
with all the variables in the deterministic case.

Now select the two input variables *F* and *L* and click button "Add" in the
upper part of the window. Select the output variable "dev" and click button
"Add" in the lower part of the window. In the end, your variables definition
window should look like this:

Note that if the deterministic case does not provide a "Variables" item, you
can still create the probabilistic variables and the variables of interest by
using the "New..." buttons.

Finally, when you have selected all the desired variables, click button
"Next >>" to proceed to the next step.
