Tutorial: Parametric study using a SALOME component as the solver code
######################################################################

This tutorial explains how to create and run a parametric study using a SALOME
component as the solver code. We will use the example calculation code
"DEVIATION" that is defined in the module GENERICSOLVER. It is an
implementation of a classical example: the computation of the deviation of a
cantilever beam.
