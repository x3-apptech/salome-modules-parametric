======================================================
Step 4: Define the solver and the execution parameters
======================================================

In this step we will define the solver to use for our parametric study. Two
types of solvers can be used with the PARAMETRIC module:

* The solver can be a Salome component that must define a few methods with
  given signatures.
* The solver can be a Python script.

In this tutorial, we use the Salome component DEVIATION that is defined in the
GENERICSOLVER module. For that, we must set the component name "DEVIATION" and
select in the object browser the deterministic case that was created in step 1.
We can also change the name of the parametric study (the name that the study
will have in the object browser) and the number of computations that will be
launched in parallel.

Finally, just click the "OK" button to validate the creation of the parametric
study. A new item representing the study appears in the object browser.
