Tutorial
########

This tutorial explains how to create and run a parametric study with the
PARAMETRIC module in Salome. In all this documentation, we will use the example
calculation code "DEVIATION" that is defined in the module GENERICSOLVER.
It is an implementation of a classical example: the computation of the
deviation of a cantilever beam.
